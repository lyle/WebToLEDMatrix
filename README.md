This project requires an Ethernet Sheild and a MAX7219 Led Matrix Unit and uses [LedControl](http://wayoda.github.io/LedControl/).

This project can read from a web service that returns a text document with ascii characters (unsigned chars, bytes) that will be rended in binary form on the right side of the LED Matrix.
